A projector display tool created for a show performed in the 2022 Calgary Fringe Theatre Festival. The application allowed performers and crew to enhance shows by displaying visuals on stage and playing sound effects in a easy-to-use way. As the application was entirely online, multiple projectors could be connected to the system without any additional work.
