A simplistic weather station written in Typescript running on a Raspberry Pi using Node.js.

<br><br>

When activated by a user using a hardware button, the application queries a custom Express server which then retrieves weather information at a specified location from multiple open-source weather APIs, 
extracts three key data-points (is it raining, windy and/or cold), and generates a sound file using the Microsoft Speech Synthesis API to be played to the querying user based on the resulting answers.
